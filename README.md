# Texdoc

This is a template repository to compile any document format
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) supports into a PDF using
[tectonic](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic).

## Example

```sh
./texdoc your-document.md
```

You can symlink it to your path to install globally, or copy texdoc to
/usr/local/bin. I just fork and use it as a self contained repository for each
document I'm building.
